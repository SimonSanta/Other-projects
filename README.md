# Other-projects

*Repository containing various projects covering several engineering disciplines including Laser Processing, 
antenna design and simulations, biomimetics engineering or even Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).*

Codes or simulations results are included in reports on each topic.

## Projects

__Project__ : *Calculation of the effect of the troposphere on the Alphasat satellite payload*, Master student at UCLouvain.

*Fig1. - Global attenuation calculation for various antennas elevations angle and signal frequencies.*

__Tasks__ : Assess feasability to transmit a signal between a Cubesat (new, cheap generation of satellite) and 2 different station on earth one located
in Louvain-La-Neuve (Belgium) and the other at McMurdo station (Antartica) under different conditions.

__Results__ : Firstly, the attenuations of the signal traveling between the satellite and the stations were computed. Secondly, from the satellite specifications, the minimum power threshold were determined for the frequencies of used. Therefore, the feasability of transmission could be assessed if the power minus the attenuation was higher than the required detection threshold.

__Project__ : *MEMS film deposition design and fabrication*, Master student at Keio University.

*Fig2. - Final technique used for each thin film.*

__Tasks__ : For 4 different target MEMS thin films, determine the film deposition techniques and the characteristics of the process for each technique.

__Results__ : Through research on film deposition for materials, a step-by-step process was designed for each particular thin film. This included the deposition technique used with chemical reactions and their characteristics, the patterning process and the final surface threatment.
